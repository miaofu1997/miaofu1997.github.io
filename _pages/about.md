Hi, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with extensive experience in user analysis, device fingerprinting, and advertising optimization. My career has focused on leveraging advanced data techniques to solve complex problems and drive business results.

In my recent roles, Iâ€™ve led impactful projects including:

- **Intelligent Advertising Decision System**: Developed a high-efficiency performance calculation process for over 3,000 advertising channels, achieving 93% prediction accuracy and securing two patents for innovative computation methods.
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Engineered a system handling 10-20 million data entries daily with 96.8% accuracy, saving the company 400,000 RMB annually.
- **User Segmentation and Analysis for [Shengbei](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%25E7%259C%2581%25E5%2591%2597-%25E6%25AD%25A3%25E8%25A7%2584%25E4%25BF%25A1%25E7%2594%25A8%25E8%25B4%25B7%25E6%25AC%25BE%25E5%2588%2586%25E6%259C%259F%25E5%2580%259F%25E9%2592%25B1%25E5%25B9%25B3%25E5%258F%25B0/id1194313045&ved=2ahUKEwi5-JWZuJSIAxU63TQHHSsuHywQFnoECBIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ptez4YusNpgddjwyvhI0S) App**: Enhanced customer acquisition and retention by comprehensively analyzing user data.
- **Intermediate Revenue Analysis**: Improved operational efficiency with automated data reporting, optimized user segmentation, boosting third-party platform registrations by 8% monthly.

I thrive on bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, combining my background in theoretical math and statistics with my technical expertise. My goal is to build scalable, efficient models that deliver precise, actionable insights and drive meaningful outcomes.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from [Hunan University of Technology and Business (HUTB)](https://www.hutb.edu.cn/). My academic journey included a summer program at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) and research at the Hunan Province Mobile Business Intelligence Lab (under the guidance of [Prof. Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-nh3cIMAAAAJ)), where I focused on statistical models, recommendation algorithms, and classification.
