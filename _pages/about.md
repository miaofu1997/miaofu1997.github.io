Hi, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data engineer and software developer at [SMY Cloud](https://www.smycloud.com/). My work primarily include user portrait, transaction behavior analysis, device fingerprinting and loan companies' advertising optimization.

As a data engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between theory and industrial application - combining my technical skills with background of theoretical math and statistics to create a fundamentally robust analysis. My goal is to always build models that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing strong, illustrative and precise conclusion.

Prior to work at SMY, I received my bachelor degree at [Hunan University of Technology and Business (HUTB)](https://www.hutb.edu.cn/), majored in **Information and Computing Science**. In sophomore year, I visited [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) as a summer student. During my undergrad, I also spent a good amount of time at the **Hunan Province Mobile Business Intelligence Lab** of HUTB, under the guidance of [Prof. Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-nh3cIMAAAAJ). My research interest combines aspects of statistical models, recommendation algorithm and classification.
