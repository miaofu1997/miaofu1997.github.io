  abstract = {Along with the development of several emerging computing paradigms and information communication technologies, it is said that cyber computing technology is playing an increasingly important role across cyber-related systems and applications. In this article, we focus on cyber-social computing and propose a computational model that integrates large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) into social recommendations for cyber-enabled online services. As a concrete application example, a graph model is built to describe the LSGDM problem among researchers in scholarly big data environments. Following the basic profiling to describe decision-makers within scholarly networks, measures are defined to evaluate one researcher's academic performance and research outcome and further quantify correlations between them based on their collaboration relationships in a constructed network model. A two-stage large-scale decision-making solution is then proposed for social recommendations: A network partition algorithm is developed based on the identification of experts along with their influence extending to a group of researchers, and a random walk with the restart-based algorithm is improved to calculate the weighted decisions for group decision aggregation and alternative ranking. Experiments using the real-world data demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposed model and method, which can provide the target researcher with more reliable recommendations.},
